# Pneumonia Diagnosis

## Description

This jupyter notebook shows how computer vision technology can aid life-saving healthcare processes. Namely, it architects a convolutional neural network that learns to diagnose pneumonia. We first spend some time reviewing why recall is adequate for healthcare tasks. Through iterative architectural enhancements and integration of pre-trained embeddings, the validation accuracy peaks at 92%, which is really good for an academic project. Finally, a statistical test is used to show improvement over other models.

## Installation

You will need to install the following dependencies to run the code:
```
pip install pillow
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage
I recommend Python 3.9 to ensure all dependencies work as intended. Anaconda also works for dependencies, but I recommend using a virtual environment with pip.

If you use an Apple Silicon like me, you can use the following article for instructions on configuring your virtual environment. https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin/
